This R Project was developed from responding to a homework prompt involving the 
Washington Post homicide data. Using this data, a map of Denver, CO was created
that reflects the total number of homicides in that city using sf framework. 
The Tigris package is used to download boundaries for sub-city geography tracts 
that are reflected as a layer underneath the points showing homicides. Faceting
was used to illustrate the solved versus unsolved homicides in Denver county. 
Different colors are used to show the three race groups with the highest 
number of homicides in descending order with any remaining race groups placed
in the 'other' category.
